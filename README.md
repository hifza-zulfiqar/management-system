Introduction 
The Blood Management System is a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe and efficient use of blood and blood products in medical settings. It encompasses a range of strategies and practices aimed at optimizing patient outcomes, minimizing unnecessary transfusions, and conserving valuable blood resources.
The primary goal of a Blood Management System is to promote patient-centered care by implementing evidence-based transfusion practices and techniques. It involves a multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare professionals such as physicians, nurses, laboratory specialists, and transfusion specialists. 
One of the key components of a Blood Management System is the careful assessment of each patient's individual needs and risks. This involves considering alternatives to blood transfusions whenever possible, such as medication optimization, minimally invasive procedures, and non-surgical treatments. By reducing the need for transfusions, the system helps minimize associated risks and complications. 
Another important aspect of the Blood Management System is the appropriate use of blood products. This includes strategies to identify patients who truly require transfusions based on evidence-based guidelines, ensuring the right blood component is administered at the right time and in the right amount. By doing so, the system helps prevent unnecessary transfusions and conserves the limited supply of blood products. 
The implementation of a Blood Management System also involves monitoring and tracking transfusion practices and outcomes. This allows healthcare providers to assess the effectiveness of their strategies, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care.
Objective
